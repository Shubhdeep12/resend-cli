# Resend CLI

CLI for [Resend](https://resend.com). Use it when the user asks to send emails, list emails, manage domains, contacts, templates, or webhooks **from the terminal** or from scripts.

## When to use

- User says "send an email from the command line", "use resend cli", "run resend in terminal"
- Task is to list/send/get emails, manage domains, contacts, templates, webhooks, or API keys via CLI
- Script or automation needs to call Resend with deterministic, parseable output (use `--json`)

## Run the CLI

**One-off (no install):**
```bash
npx @shubhdeep12/resend-cli --help
```

**With auth:**
```bash
export RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxx"
npx @shubhdeep12/resend-cli <group> <command> [options]
```

**No Node.js:** Download the binary for your OS from [Releases](https://github.com/Shubhdeep12/resend-cli/releases/latest), extract, and run the executable.

**Binaries:** Standalone executables (darwin arm64/x64, linux x64, windows x64) are built per release. No Node or npm required; download the archive for your platform, extract, and run (e.g. `resend-cli-<version>-darwin-arm64` or `resend-cli-<version>-win-x64.exe`). Checksums are on the release page.

## Behavior contract

- **Exit code:** `0` on success, non-zero on failure.
- **Data commands:** Always add `--json` for a single JSON payload (e.g. `resend emails list --json`, `resend domains list --json`).
- **Pagination:** List commands support `--limit`, `--after`, `--before`.
